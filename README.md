# PrincetonAlgorithmsAssignments
This repository contains my solutions to the assignments for the course ["Algorithms, part I"](https://coursera.org/share/d8124fd791622db91dba4e4bd9c612fd) by Robert Sedgewich and Kevin Wayne for the Princeton University.

## Dependencies
In order to run the assignments you need to download and add to the dependencies the [algs4.jar](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/) library.
